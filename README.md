Embedded C Program Codes using Keil Software.
Embedded C programs for ARM Cortex M31.Embedded C program to a)Blink LED connected at P1.28 continuouslyb)Using array of LEDs –DisplayHexadecimal , Ring and Twisted Ring counterc)Read the Status of Switch connected at P0.27. Ifswitchis HIGH turn on the Relay and else of the relay connected at P0.22.d)Beep a buzzer connected at P0.21 ten times2.a)  Display a String “Welcome to PESU”on Line of the LCD Displayb) Read a switch, If switch is HIGH display “HIGH”else display “LOW”and also operate the relay3.a)  Programto on-chip ADCto convert the Analog input into digital form. If the Measured Value is above Reference value then Turn On Relay else turn OFF the relay.b) Programto on-chip ADCto convert the Analog input into digital form. If the Measured Value is  above  Reference  value  then  Turn on  Relay  else  turn  OFF  the  relay  and  display  appropriate message on LCD4.a) Program to transmita string using UART with a baud-rate 9600.b) Program to receivethe key pressed in keyboard of PC. If key pressed is ‘1’then turn ON LED, if ‘0’turn off the LED else No action.
