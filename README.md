Embedded C programs for ARM Cortex M31 using Keil Software.

1) Blink LED connected at P1.28 continuously;

2) Using array of LEDs –Display Hexadecimal;

3) Using array of LEDs –Display Ring;  

4) Using array of LEDs –Display Twisted Ring counter;

5) Read the Status of Switch connected at P0.27. If switch is HIGH turn on the Relay and else of the relay connected at P0.22;

6) Beep a buzzer connected at P0.21 ten times;

7) Display a String “Welcome” on Line of the LCD Display;

8) Read a switch, If switch is HIGH display “HIGH” else display “LOW” and also operate the relay;

9) Program to on-chip ADC to convert the Analog input into digital form. If the Measured Value is above Reference value then Turn On Relay else turn OFF the relay;

10) Program to on-chip ADC to convert the Analog input into digital form. If the Measured Value is  above  Reference  value  then  Turn on  Relay  else  turn  OFF  the  relay  and  display  appropriate message on LCD;

11) Program to transmita string using UART with a baud-rate 9600;

12) Program to receivethe key pressed in keyboard of PC. If key pressed is ‘1’ then turn ON LED, if ‘0’ turn off the LED else No action.
